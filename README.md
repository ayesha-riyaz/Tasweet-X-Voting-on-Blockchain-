# Tasweet-X Graduation Project
 
Project Objectives:
Every year, elections are conducted in some parts of the world. While democracy was established to establish trust and giving power and voice to the normal citizens, the voting mechanism still has some loopholes to be fixed.
TasweetX is developed to solve all the voting issues and establish trust in the process.

 
Our solution/approach:
Our approach to the problem (project) is making voting simple for voters and trustworthy and as legitimate as possible for both voters and candidates. Voting for a candidate can be as simple as visiting a website. Voters would have to login and verify their identity, before they are issued their digital id, making voting completely anonymous. This also ensures that the voter is an actual human being. The voter database will be distributed among everyone. No single authority will control the elections. With the election so transparent, each voter can open the ballot box database, locate and check their vote remains unaltered. By tallying all these information even illegitimate votes can be prevented.

 
Our blockchain voting system, TasweetX, will allow voters to cast votes to their chosen candidates based on the Emirate they are in. Regulatory Authorities will be responsible for managing candidates and control the activation and deactivation of the election period.


This is a university project and these are the web-pages from the front-end for the Regulatory Authority.
